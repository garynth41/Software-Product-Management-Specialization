This is a blog post written by Mike Cohn on his blog, Mountain Goat Software. This post describes how and why Agile processes are more successful than the traditional waterfall model. If you have not visited Mountain Goat Software before, I highly recommend you check it out. It is (in my opinion) one of the best resources out there for Agile information. If I ever have any questions about Agile development, that is always the first place that I look.
