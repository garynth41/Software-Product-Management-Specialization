Module 2: Foundations of Software Product Management

Instructor: Kenny Wong
Welcome to the second half of Introduction to Software Product Management. In this module you will learn the philosophy, core values,​ and principles of Agile software development. ​The​ Agile philosophy has reshaped modern software development. ​ Challenge yourself by thinking about how you would deliver a successful software product within the “triangle” of (a) meeting client needs, (b) delivering on schedule, and (c) staying within budget. ​This module will also preview software product management in four foundational areas: establishing a process, defining requirements, planning the work, and monitoring development. You’ll see the important role they play in producing better software.
